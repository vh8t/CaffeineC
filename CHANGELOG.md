# Windows pre-built LLVM binaries
I have been trying to locate up-to-date pre-built LLVM binaries for windows, but haven't had much success.
The new workflows will attempt to build the binaries for windows from a github actions runner, and then embed them in the windows version of the CaffeineC compiler. This will make the Winodws version of the compiler a little bigger.
