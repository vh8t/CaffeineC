# CaffeineC
Idk why I'm doing this, so don't ask.
## Building the compiler
It's pretty easy, you need to have Golang installed though.

Run `go build ./src` in the project's root directory to build the executable.

Once you have the executable you use it like this: `./CaffeineC <file_to_compile>`.

If everything goes well, you should be left with a executable file named `output`.
## Troubleshooting
This has really only been tested on linux.

Make sure every command is being executed in the project's root directory.
