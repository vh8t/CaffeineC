# CaffeineC
Idk why I'm doing this, so don't ask.

Time spent working on this project: 

[![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/vyPal/CaffeineC.svg)](https://wakatime.com/badge/github/vyPal/CaffeineC)
## Installing
Auto-install script in bash: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vyPal/CaffeineC/master/install.bash | bash`
Installation instructions can be found [here](https://c.vypal.me/getting-started/installing-the-compiler)

## Troubleshooting
I really only test this on linux, if there is some issue you cant fix, try removing all directories created by CaffeineC.
On linux you can use these commands:
```bash
rm -r ~/.local/lib/CaffeineC/*
rm /usr/local/bin/CaffeineC
rm /usr/local/lib/CaffeineC_autocomplete
```

## Documentation
Documentation has been moved to [the wiki](https://c.vypal.me/getting-started/creating-a-new-project).
